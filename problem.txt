Largest Gap
we are given with an unsorted array,
we have to find largest gap between any pair of elements of array.
for ex 
	1)  {3,4,1,6,2,7,5}
	o/p 6 
	because 7-1 is 6
	2) {-3, -1, 6, 7, 0}
	o/p 10
	because 7-(-3)=10
solutions
	1) first approach to solve this is
		in o(n^2) check each pair for largest gap by two for loops
		initially take diff= Integer.Min_VALUE;(minimum value among integers)
		
	2) second approach to solve in o(n) greedy method
		find max and min among array in o(n) and calculate their difference
